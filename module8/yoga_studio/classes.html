        <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
        <p>"Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your mat with your arms at your side with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position. Be grateful for all that you have in life.
